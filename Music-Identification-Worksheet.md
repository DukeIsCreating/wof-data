I am compiling a list of music used in Wheel of Fortune. I'm looking to identify Artist and Title for all pieces. Any help that can be given would be greatly appreciated.

# General Notes

"Slug" is my own mnemonic ID for the music piece. It will probably change as information becomes available.
Values in [Square Brackets] are unknown or uncertain.

I have provided the season, episode, round number, and contestant names of the first occurrence known to me of each prize bed music in the format "S#-E####-R# (Player1/Player2/Player3)". If my sample of audio was bad for that episode, I assume that yours might be too and provide another example episode. This information can be used to help with identification.

# Prize Beds (One-offs and diagetics)

Sometimes a prize bed would have audio or music unique to that occasion. One example is when Vanna plays the floor piano.
Other examples are single-use holiday music
