As a fan of the game, I have been compiling gameplay-related information about the game for personal use at home. However, I'm more than willing to share the fruits of my research here.

## Chaos Disclaimer

Please note that as of now everything is in a preliminary state. Schemas, folder layouts, etc. are subject to change based on what works and what doesn't.

## Data Sets

## Credits

My information is compiled from several sources:

Foremost, the Buy A Vowel Boards and its members (https://buyavowel.boards.net/) have been an indispensible source of information, including but not limited to episode recaps, puzzles, and wheel layouts.

The Wheel of Fortune History Fandom (https://wheeloffortunehistory.fandom.com) has also been a valuable source of various information.

And lots of fun time analyzing episode video.

## Terms of Use

The information I have compiled here regards a series of public contests, and I claim no ownership or copyright over the data contained within.

Having said that, in addition to the efforts of those above, I too have put a lot of personal time into compiling this information. Don't try to commercialize it. If you find it useful and/or redistribute it, please give credit where it is due. You may simply credit me as "Duke".
