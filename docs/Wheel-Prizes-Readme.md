# Wheel Prizes

Contains a database of wheel prizes offered.

## Data Elements

For each prize, I have attempted to capture:
- the Episode and Round in which the prize was added to the wheel
- Which prize wedge was used, including variant information
- Which prize bed music was used
- The stated value of the prize
- An abbreviation of the prize plug describing the prize, or the full prize plug. (moving to full prize plugs over time)
- The position of the prize wedge on the wheel
- What happened to the prize wedge in gameplay
- Any other miscellaneous notes.

## About Wedge Variants

There are SO MANY prize wedge variants. (Over 400 and still climbing!) A new wedge variant is specified whenever a sample of a prize wedge is found that has discernable differences in typography or positioning of the letters on the prize wedge.

This can be challenging, because differences in video quality (especially color/brightness bleed), angle of shot, and lighting differences can cause the false perception of discernable differences. All I can say is that I've done my best, and if things need to be regrouped its easy enough to do.

Variants are named by the text on the wedge, the season they first occur in, and if necessary, a single letter qualifier discerning variant when multiple variants of the same wedge text appear initially in a season. These name elements are separated by a pin (-). For Example:

```
RING-S1
TRIP-S1-A
TRIP-S1-B
```
It should happen infrequently, but if it is found that a wedge variant appeared in an earlier season than originally thought, the variant name will be updated to reference the correct initial season.
